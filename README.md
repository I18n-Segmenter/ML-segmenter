# ML Segmenters

This project is about searching for the best ML algorithm that can give a high accuracy for word segmentations.


# Background
TBD.

# Segmenters

In this section, we are going to discuss different algorithms and test them for the following criteria. 
1. Accuracy
1. Memory Usage
1. Performance

and we are going to use testing measurement for each of the following locales:
1. Thai
1. Chinese
1. ... etc.


## LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory
In this part, LSTM algorithm will be applied for each locale respectively.

### 1. Thai

TBD.
